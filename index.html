                                    pest-resistent plants.

                                    well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.

                                    we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops
                                    are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying
                                    plants and animals for a long time. Long before we called it science,
                                    people were selecting the best breeds."
