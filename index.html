                <h2>Here is the timeline of Kittie's life</h2>

                        University of Minnesota, thanks to a Depression era program known as the

                        in the Civilian Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span>1937</span> - Finishes university and takes a job in the US

                        laid off due to budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he
                        returns to school study under Stakman, who teaches him about breeding
                        pest-resistent plants.
                    </li>
                    <li>

                        Harbor attack, but is rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to
                        work on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria, disinfectants, and
                        other applied science.

                        pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000
                        different strains of disease resistent wheat - including different
                        varieties for each major climate on Earth.
                    </li>
                        <li>

                        with a high-yeidling American breed, creating a strain that responds
                        well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.
                        </li>

                        mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding population
                        </li>
                        <li>1970 - receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li>

                        <li>
                        2005 - states "we will have to double the world food
                        supply by 2050." Argues that genetically modified crops are the only way
                        we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops
                        are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying
                        plants and animals for a long time. Long before we called it science,
                        people were selecting the best breeds."
